# Just-Maths
Android game developed while self-learning android app development. The game basically randomly generates Maths addition questions and a result. The user has to verify whether the result is correct or wrong. If the user verifies the result correctly, he/she gains 5 points. The game ends when the countdown timer from (60seconds) runs out.

Key Learning Pointers:
1) User Interface Development (Total of 3 Activities)
2) View and View Group Management
3) Use of both Explicit and Implicit Intent Implementations
4) Developing a Countdown Timer
5) Developing a Score Updater
